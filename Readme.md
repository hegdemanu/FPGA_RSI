# üöÄ RSI FSM Implementation in FPGA (Verilog)

## üìö **Project Overview**
This project implements a **Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculation FSM** in Verilog for FPGA-based trading systems. It processes incoming price data and generates trading signals based on RSI thresholds. The system uses a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to manage data fetching, RSI computation, and decision-making efficiently. A **pipelined division module** ensures accurate division with an 8-clock cycle latency.

## üìù **Core Components**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **FSM Controller**
- Handles price fetching, RSI computation, and decision-making.
- Ensures sequential processing of states to maintain FSM integrity.
- Manages FIFO initialization tracking to prevent invalid calculations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Price FIFO**
- 14-entry FIFO stores price history.
- Tracks initialization status to ensure valid data before computation.
- Maintains count of valid entries for proper calculation initiation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **RSI Calculation Block**
- Computes gain and loss for each period.
- Uses exponential smoothing for average gain/loss.
- Implements fixed-point arithmetic for enhanced calculation precision.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Pipelined Divider**
- 8-cycle latency division for computing RS.
- Prevents division by zero using denominator checks.
- Controlled via start/done handshaking for reliable operation.

## üß† **RSI Computation Formula**
The RSI is computed using the following formula:

\[
RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}
\]

\[
RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}
\]

### **Smoothing Formula**
\[
\text{New Avg Gain} = \frac{(13 \times \text{Prev Avg Gain}) + \text{Current Gain}}{14}
\]
\[
\text{New Avg Loss} = \frac{(13 \times \text{Prev Avg Loss}) + \text{Current Loss}}{14}
\]

### **Fixed-Point Implementation**
- Uses bit-shifting for enhanced precision in RSI calculation
- Implements the formula: `RSI <= 100 - ((100 << 8) / ((1 << 8) + RS)) >> 8`
- Provides more accurate results than simple integer division

## ‚ö° **Division Module (pipelined_divider)**
- 8-cycle pipelined division for high accuracy.

## üß™ **Test Bench Guidelines**
1. **Initial Reset:** Apply a reset for 2 clock cycles.  
2. **Feed Price Data:** Simulate new price data with `new_price` high.  
3. **Wait States:** Allow sufficient cycles for division completion (8 cycles).
4. **FIFO Initialization:** Provide at least 14 price entries before expecting valid RSI.
5. **Check RSI Values:** Validate RSI output after sufficient price entries.  
6. **Test Buy/Sell Conditions:** Confirm buy/sell signals at RSI < 30 and RSI > 70.

- Optimized for generic FPGA implementation with no vendor-specific features.
- Uses fixed-point arithmetic for enhanced precision without floating-point units.
- Division module latency managed with dedicated wait state.
- Expanded bit widths prevent overflow in gain/loss accumulation.
- FIFO initialization tracking prevents invalid calculations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling**
- EOD reset ensures clean state transition.  
- Division by zero is avoided with safe fallback.  
- Initial RSI values default to zero until full FIFO population.
- Proper FIFO initialization tracking prevents premature calculations.
