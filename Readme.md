# üöÄ RSI FSM Implementation in FPGA (Verilog)

## üìö **Project Overview**
This project implements a **Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculation FSM** in Verilog for FPGA-based trading systems. It processes incoming price data and generates trading signals based on RSI thresholds. The system uses a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to manage data fetching, RSI computation, and decision-making efficiently. A **pipelined division module** ensures accurate division with configurable latency.

## üß† **RSI Computation Formula**

The RSI is computed using the following formulas:

$$
RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}
$$

$$
RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}
$$

### **Smoothing Formula**

$$
\text{New Avg Gain} = \frac{(13 \times \text{Prev Avg Gain}) + \text{Current Gain}}{14}
$$

$$
\text{New Avg Loss} = \frac{(13 \times \text{Prev Avg Loss}) + \text{Current Loss}}{14}
$$

## üß™ **Test Bench Guidelines**
1. **Initial Reset:** Apply a reset for 2 clock cycles.  
2. **Feed Price Data:** Simulate new price data with `new_price` high.  
3. **Wait States:** Allow sufficient cycles for division completion.  
4. **FIFO Initialization:** Provide at least 14 price entries before expecting valid RSI.  
5. **Check RSI Values:** Validate RSI output after sufficient price entries.  
6. **Test Buy/Sell Conditions:** Confirm buy/sell signals at RSI < 30 and RSI > 70.  
7. **Monitor Debug Signals:** Check `state_out` and `fifo_ready` signals.
